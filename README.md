# bike-route-signage
A proposal for new bike route signs for Vienna, inspired by "Totem style" sign ins London.

A route is defined by a simple YAML file. This application renders how a sign would look like at a speciific location along this route. With the menu and the map you can move to different locations to see how the signage would change along the route.

There's also an editor included. You can download the modified file.
